# GitHub-Themed Conway's Game of Life

An interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life with GitHub contribution graph-inspired styling.

## Features

- Responsive design that fills the entire viewport
- GitHub contribution graph color scheme
- Dynamic cell coloring based on neighbor count
- 10px square cells with rounded corners
- 0.5-second generation updates
- Wrapping grid edges

## Color Scheme

The cells use GitHub's contribution graph colors:
- `#9be9a8`: Cells with 0 neighbors
- `#40c463`: Cells with 1 neighbor
- `#30a14e`: Cells with 2 neighbors
- `#216e39`: Cells with 3 or more neighbors

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The simulation will start automatically with a random initial state.
